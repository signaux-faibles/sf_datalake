    The data is split into 2 subsets: learn, test. The original set can be split
    in a stratified fashion and based on separate groups.

    Args:
        df: The DataFrame to split.
        random_seed: Controls the random sampling process.
        train_size: Should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the
          dataset to include in the train split. If None, will be set to 0.8.
        test_size: Should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the
          dataset to include in the test split.
        group_col: If not None, the two sets won't share any common value for this
          column, which is therefore considered as a group label.

        A tuple of two DataFrame associated with the training and testing stages.
